## About Handlebars.js

It's a great JS templating engine, based on [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/), but adding the ability to precompile templates and to create custom helpers.

Official website: [handlebarsjs.com](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

## Installation

Get it through [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

If you haven't used it yet, just install it from the link above and then:

1. Press Shift + Command (or Control) + P
2. Type "install", to bring up the "Package Control: Install Package" option, and press Enter
3. Look for "Handlebars", and press Enter to install it.
4. Choose "Handlebars" in the bottom right corner with one of your template files open
5. Profit

Package Control will also autoupdate the package from this point on!

## Precompilation

This package does not offer any Handlebars precompilation functionality to keep things simple, but you can use [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) (which is a file system watcher) and [Guard-Steering](https://github.com/guard/guard-steering) (a Handlebars precompiler from yours truly) to have all templates precompiled as you save them.

There's also a [Guard package for Sublime](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard) if you want integration, but I don't personally use this as I'm happy with Guard running in an iTerm window I can access from anywhere.

There are of course Node.js / Grunt based compilers too ([like this](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-handlebars-js)), but I haven't personally used any yet.
