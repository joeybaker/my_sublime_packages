        CHECKBOUNCE FOR ST2 & ST3       
=========================================
    * 07 April 2013---Grammar checking
      added; discovery that OS X's built-in
      grammar checker is sort of lame
      made.
    * 06 April 2013---Fully compatible
      with both ST2 and ST3. Runs in the
      background, corrects documents in
      any language, generally shames the
      Sublime spell-checker. It's been
      thoroughly tested, but please
      report any errors to the author,
      Daniel, through the Github Issues
      interface at
  https://github.com/phyllisstein/CheckBounce
      or via e-mail, to d at daniel dot sh.
      Happy checking!
