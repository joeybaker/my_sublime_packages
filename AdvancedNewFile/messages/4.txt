New Features/Enhancements:

- Enabling "use_cursor_text" will fill with selected regions. The first cursor/region to match the conditions (region or quoted section) will be used.
- Autocompleting with tab where there is only a single completion option will continue completion on subsequent directories.

Please see the README for more information about the new settings.

Bug Fixes:
- Properly display completions when using "ctrl+space" to manually display auto complete options.
- Prevent error pop up from occuring when explicitly creating a directory structure.
- Fix bug where using cursor text causes an error.
- Prevent spaces from being inserted when tab is without a possible completion.
