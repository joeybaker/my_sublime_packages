--------------------

*** IMPORTANT! ***

PLEASE read this entire message!


*** BUG REPORTING ***

Before running for help, please take the time to read the Troubleshooting
guide, which has been greatly expanded in this version.

https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter.github.io/wiki/Troubleshooting

If you still have a problem, please use github issues only for verified bugs.
If you have a general usage question, or are having trouble with installation
or configuration, please use the SublimeLinter google group. That way everyone will
benefit from the answer.

Even if you suspect there is a bug, it's better to ask on the group first
and then file an issue on github only after it has been confirmed that it's a bug.

*** HAVE YOU READ THE DOCS? ***

If not, you are probably missing out on a lot of great new features in
SublimeLinter 3. At least read the Usage docs.

A searchable version of docs with a Table of Contents is in the works.


*** KEYBOARD CHANGES ***

The Mac OS X keyboard equivalent for Show All Errors is now Control+Command+A.


*** LIVE GUTTER THEME PREVIEW! ***

You can now preview gutter themes in the chooser! For more info, see:

*** LINTER PLUGIN AUTHORS ***

If you have already written a linter plugin, thank you! Please note
that the usage of error_stream has changed a bit, please read:

*** KEEP SUBLIMELINTER ALIVE! ***

I have now spent two solid months on SublimeLinter, and there is still lots to do.

I am very grateful to everyone who has donated so far to support
SublimeLinter. But many have not. If everyone who relies on SublimeLinter
donated even a few dollars, I wouldn't have to worry. But the reality is
that without more financial support, I simply cannot continue to provide
the same level of support for SublimeLinter.

I'm sorry to have to beg for donations, but open source software is not free
-- the developers usually end up paying for it!

Thank you for your support!
