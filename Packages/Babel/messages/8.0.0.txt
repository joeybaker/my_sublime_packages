If you're on the Sublime Text 3 dev channel and using the latest Sublime
build, you should now see substantially improved JSX matching:

  1. A few lingering edge-cases w.r.t. JSXText have been fixed.

  2. JSX matching won't interfere with Flow annotations. This is a huge step
     towards full Flow support. Before, some Flow arrays got matched as JSX
     and that made a mess. Now, they won't get matched, and at worst it just
     looks plain.

That's it.
