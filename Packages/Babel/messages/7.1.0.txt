Big improvements are coming soon to support flow type annotations. You may
already start to notice some of them, like ES7 property initializers getting
properly matched. But it's coming at a cost:

There are currently two syntax definitions supporting different builds of
Sublime Text 3 (ST2 doesn't work with either). One is the evolution of the
other using Sublime's new "sublime-syntax" format. That new format allows for
more complex matches, thus paving the way for flow support. If you're using
Sublime Text 3 dev then you're already using the new syntax, if you're
using the beta, then you're still using the old syntax.

Here's the plan:

1. Once the next Sublime Text 3 beta build comes out (whenever that is), I'll
be removing the old syntax from the package. Since, that means that most
(if not all) users will be able to use the new syntax. If you still need
the old syntax, Don't Panic, you can clone the repo and run it like that.
I'll put up instructions if that's thing someone wants.

2. "Monokai Phoenix" will also go away. If you're running ST3 dev, and you're
using Monokai Phoenix, you can already switch the stock Monokai and things
will look mostly the same. The new syntax uses more generic scope names that
make it more theme friendly.

That's all.
