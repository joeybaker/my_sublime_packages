## How to install

This is not supported yet. When Sublime Text 3 is released, the ST3 branch will be merged into the master and the ST3 support will be enabled through Package Control.

#### Git Clone
Clone this repository in to the Sublime Text 2 or 3 "Packages" directory, which is located where ever the
"Preferences" -> "Browse Packages" option in Sublime Text takes you.
