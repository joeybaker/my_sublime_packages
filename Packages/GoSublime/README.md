GoSublime
=========

Intro
-----

GoSublime is a Golang plugin collection for the text editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) providing code completion and other IDE-like features. Only Sublime Text **3** is supported.

Before using GoSublime you should read and understand [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime/blob/master/SUPPORT.md)

Features
--------

* code completion from [Gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode)
* context aware snippets via the code-completion popup to complement the existing SublimeText Go package.
* sublime build system(ctrl+b) integrating with GoSublime 9o command prompt
* lint/syntax check as you type
* quickly jump to any syntax error reported (and jump back to where you were before (across files))
* quickly fmt your source or automatically on save to conform with the Go standards
* easily create a new go file and run it without needing to save it first (9o `replay`)
* share your snippets (anything in the loaded file) on play.golang.org
* list declarations in the current file
* automatically add/remove package imports
* quickly jump your import section(automatically goes to the last import) where you can easily edit the pkg alias and return to where you were before
* go to definition of a package function or constant, etc.
* show the source(and thus documentation) of a variable without needing to change views

Installation
------------

It is assumed that you have a working installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and know how to use it to clone and update repositories.

Run the command `git clone https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime` from within the Sublime Text `Packages` directory.
The location of your Sublime Text Packages directory can be found by clicking the menu: `Preferences` > `Browse Packages...`.

Usage
-----

Please see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) and [9o.md](9o.md) for general usage and other tips for effective usage of GoSublime

**NOTE** GoCode is entirely integrated into GoSublime/MarGo. If you see any bugs related to completion,
assume they are GoSublime's bugs and I will forward bug reports as necessary.

Settings
--------

You can customize the behaviour of GoSublime by creating a settings file in your `User` package. This can be accessed from within SublimeText by going to the menu `Preferences > Browse Packages...`. Create a file named `GoSublime.sublime-settings` or alternatively copy the default settings file `Packages/GoSublime/GoSublime.sublime-settings` to your `User` package and edit it to your liking.

Note: File names are case-sensitive on some platforms (e.g. Linux) so the file name should be exactly `GoSublime.sublime-settings` with capitalization preserved.
