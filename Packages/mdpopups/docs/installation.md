Installing Sublime Markdown Popups.

---

## Package Control
In order for your plugin to utilize Markdown Popups, you must be using Package Control, and you must add `mdpopups` as a dependency for your plugin.  This can be done in one of two ways, both of which are documented at Package Control's [documents site](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies); see **Using Dependencies**.  Package Control will install the and update the dependency for you.  Package Control will also ensure that `mdpopups` is loaded before your plugin loads.

Remember, Markdown Popups are for Sublime Text 3 builds 3080+.
