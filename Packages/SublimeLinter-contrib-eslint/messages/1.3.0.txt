# SublimeLinter-eslint

v1.3.0

ESLint version was changed to 0.12.0. 

JavaScript (JSX) and JavaScript (Babel) syntax were added. Enable JSX validation in your `.eslintrc` file:

```
"ecmaFeatures": {
    "jsx": true
}
```

Or still skip to lint `.jsx` files with your `.sublimelinterrc` configuration:

```

"linters": {
    "eslint": {
        "excludes": ["**/*.jsx"]
    }
}
```
