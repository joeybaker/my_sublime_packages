Thank you for using Syntax Highlighting for Sass.

With over 80 improvements this package now works much better than ever! Here are some new features:

## Improved lots of highlighting rules and fully support Sass 3.3 syntax

## Built-in Completion Packages

    There are 8 built-in completion packages. Pick up the package name which you are not intend to use, then add it/them into the `ignored_packages` list of your settings file. (If you know a better way to do this please please let me know.)

    * SHS-At-Rule
    * SHS-Bourbon
    * SHS-Bourbon-Neat
    * SHS-Compass-Mixins
    * SHS-Compass-Variables
    * SHS-CSS-Properties
    * SHS-CSS-Property-Values
    * SHS-Sass-Functions

## Smart Completion Rule

    1. Typing @-rule, ID, class, placeholder-selector, mixin name, function name, comment, and quoted content will never popup any completions.
    2. ** When typing property values, property name and other completions will no longer popup.
    3. Built-in mixin name completions will only popup directly behind `@include` or `+`.
    4. Built-in variable compltions will only popup when you typing variables.

    ** The latest version of [Emmet CSS Snippets](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet%20Css%20Snippets) now fully supports this feature. I recommend to use it instead of the built-in properties completion package.

## Improved support for Goto Symbol and Goto Definition features

## Comment Tag

    Use `{{` and `}}` to wrap a keyword inside comment, then this keyword (comment tag) will be indexed by the Goto Symbol and Goto Definition features.
