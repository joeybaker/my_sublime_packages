SublimeLinter-jshint 1.0.7
---------------------------

- You may now specify your own config file by setting
  the "args" linter setting to "--config /path/to/file".

- If jshint generates an error, for example if there
  is an error in a config file (.jshintrc or custom)
  or if it cannot find the config file you specify
  in the "args" setting, a lint error at the top of
  the file will be generated with the error message
  from jshint, so you can figure out what went wrong.
