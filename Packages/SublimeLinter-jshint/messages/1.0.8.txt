SublimeLinter-jshint 1.0.8
---------------------------

- When specifying a config file with the "args" linter setting,
  to be safe it is best to use an array:

  "args": ["--config", "/path/to/file"]

  On Windows, be sure to double the backslashes:

  "args": ["--config", "C:\\path\\to\\file"]

- If jshint generates an error, SublimeLinter *tries*
  to retrieve the error, but unfortunately on Windows
  it is not working reliably. It seems to be a bug in python.
  So if you specify a custom config file and the path
  is invalid, jshint will just silently fail.
