--------------------------
SublimeLinter-jshint 1.0.3
--------------------------

This release allows you to use .jshintrc files exactly
as you would when running jshint from the command line
and passing a file. It starts searching in the directory
of the linted file, and continues up to the root directory.

Note: The linter plugin does this by searching for a `.jshintrc`
file itself and setting the `--config` option if it finds one,
so you cannot use that option in the linterâ€™s `"args"` setting.
