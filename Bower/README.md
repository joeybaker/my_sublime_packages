## Installation

* Install bower using NPM: `npm install bower -g`
* Ensure that the bower binary is available in your path (type `bower` into your Terminal / Command prompt)
* [Install msysgit](https://github.com/twitter/bower#a-note-for-windows-users) (Windows only)

Sublime Package Control allows you to easily install or remove sublime-bower (and many other packages) from within the editor. It offers automatically updating packages as well so you no longer need to keep track of changes in sublime-bower.

* Install Sublime Package Control (if you haven't done so already) from http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

* Bring up the command palette (default ctrl+shift+p or cmd+shift+p) and start typing Package Control: Install Package then press return or click on that option to activate it. You will be presented with a new Quick Panel with the list of available packages. (Search for "Bower")

Alternately, instead of using Package Control, you can manually install sublime-bower (be aware, you'll have to fetch updates yourself):

On Mac OS X, in your Terminal:

```bash
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
  git clone git://github.com/benschwarz/sublime-bower.git Bower
```

On Windows, inside a command prompt (cmd.exe):

```cmd
  cd "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages"
  git clone git://github.com/benschwarz/sublime-bower.git Bower
```

## Platforms

* Works on Sublime text 2 & 3
* Works on Mac, Linux & Windows
