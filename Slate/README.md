# Slate

Syntax highlighting and comment preferences for [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate).


## Installing

I highly recommend installing via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).


## Usage

The package by default recognizes `*.slate` as a Slate config file.
