Dictionary Auto-Complete
========================

![Pic](http://www.mediafire.com/conv/192f62de03bd6fe2c26294faa932583c1a41bf47b48c96dd9dd41a9ac925277d6g.jpg)

This plug-in adds auto-completion entries from the dictionary file if you are typing inside comments or in strings.
Useful for very lazy typers or if you're searching for a particular word.

In a comment or string, just type Ctrl + Space to show auto-completion.


Alternatively, you can add this entry to your 'Settings - User' to always show auto-completion, regardless where you're typing:
<pre>"auto_complete_selector": "source"</pre>


Installation
------------
**Very easy with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) right inside Sublime Text 2 (Package Control needs to be installed):**

1.	Ctrl + shift + P
2.  Search for "inst", hit enter
3.  Search for "DictionaryAutoComplete", hit enter

**Manually (not recommended):**

1.  Clone or download this package
2.	Put it into your Packages directory (find using 'Preferences' -> 'Browse Packages...')
